      around the town looking things that could possibly induce noise pollution in my neighbourhood

      <p>
        I conducted all the interviews during the afternoon, I chose the after noon because that's when people are the most energetic and open
        to tolearating random questions. I chose to interview 10 people at random and took notes of responses. Some people were willing to be recorded
        and give me there names while others only agreed to being interviewed but didn't want there name to be put out nor did they want to be recorded.     </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Observations:</strong> Time of day, noises observed, and most bothersome noise</li>
        <li><strong>Interviews:</strong> 8 residents asked about safety, comfort, and annoyances.</li>

            is 2.8 miles away from Bordeaux Apartments. Based on my abservations throughout the day, I learnt that the loudest sounds come from the NAS Kingsville because
            it is used as a training base for prospective fighter jet pilots. Because of during the week during the afternoons, you can hear constant
            whirring of a

          <h3>2. Consistent Noises</h3>
          <p>
            Bordeaux Apartments is located near a Walmart and a major highway, which leads to consistent noise from traffic and shoppers.
            And since the apartments are located near a major highway, there tend to be many people who rev their engines late at night which tends
            to disturb the peace and quiet of the neighborhood.

          <h3>3. Animals</h3>
          <p>
            Many residents mentioned that neighborhood dogs barking can be disruptive, especially in the early morning or late evening. Throughout thanksgiving break,
            I got woken up multiple times because of dogs barking or the cats fighting in the neighborhood which made it hard to get a peaceful sleep.

          <h3>4. Bothersome but Bareable Sounds</h3>
          <p>
            Out of all the noises, I the sound that kept being mentioned was the sound of the train. There is a railway that crosses through Kingsville and,
            it is about a 2 miles away from Bordeaux Apartments. The train tends to pass by 2 times a week and when ever it does, it blares its horn
            for more than 5 minutes which can be very disruptive to the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. Despite this from my own personal experience and talking with my neighbors,
            the noise of the train although bothersome, it is also bareable because the train's schedule is always sporradic. Sometimes it comes 2 times a week and sometimes it is only once every 2 weeks.

        <h2>Observation Notes</h2>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sound Theory #1 :</strong> Despite the train sounds being the loudest, People find car noises and the animal sounds(barking, cats fighting, etc.) to be way more annoying than the sounds of jets and trains.</li>
        <li><strong>Sound Theory #2 :</strong> Regardless of age, I learnt that the longer people have resided in this neighborhood, they have a much easier time tolerating a lot of the noises.</li>
        <li><strong>Sound Theory #3:</strong> People find the noises of cars and animals to be more annoying because they hear them much more than the jets and train. In short sounds of animals and cars are more annoying because they are more frequent.</li>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-header">
        <h2>Conclusions I reached:</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        In the NOISSEEEEE page, I introducted my hypothesss regarding the noises in my neighborhood and listed out some theories that I had regarding the noises.
        After conducting my observations and interviews, I have come to the conclusion that my hypothesis was completely reveresed. I had thought that the loudest and most disruptive noise
        would be the sound of the train horn or the jets but after conducting my research, I found that people find the consistent noises from cars revving down the street or animals barking to be more disruptive
        to their daily lives. This is because unlike the train or jets, which happen 2 times a week or even less frequently, the sounds from cars and animals happen multiple times a day and can be very hard to ignore and 
        are much more consistent throughout the year. All of
